## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flex box
- Media queries

### What I learned

- I learned that for border-radius sometimes it is more useful to use pixels rather than percentages.
- I learned that for width related tasks it makes sense to use viewport width.
- I had more practice with Grid layout and learned that you can mix grid-template-areas and grid-template-columns.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus on following areas which aren't implemented in testimonials-grid:
- SCSS and Block Element Modifiers for more structured CSS
- Implementing common code using React components 
- Implement project using mobile-first development

### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Was useful as it contains links to all topics neccessary to make Grid layout work.
- [MDN - Ordering flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items) - MDN documentation on how to order items in flex box.
- [YT - CSS Grid Layout Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o) - Very short and useful introduction to Grid layout.
