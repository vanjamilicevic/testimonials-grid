          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

        <p class="card-testimonial">
          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found in incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at VR startup."

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recomended!

        <p class="card-testimonial">
          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a waythat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviws as an example of my development
          experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
          after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! "

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

          "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
